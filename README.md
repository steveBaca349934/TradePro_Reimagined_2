# TradePro_Reimagined_2

## The Time Has Come To Refactor TradePro Reimagined 
### The purpose of refactoring TradePro Reimagined is that the previous version of TradePro is built with Django Core
* I want to transition to using a real Rest API framework, because this will ensure the options are relatively limitless for this project
